## Getting Started

To get started with HARAYA, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

1. Clone or download the HARAYA repository to your local machine:

        https://github.com/gpbacay/PROJECT_H.A.R.A.Y.A.git

   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

        C:\Users\Gianne Bacay\Desktop\PROJECT_H.A.R.A.Y.A\haraya.py

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`, the Python package manager. Execute the following command:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the necessary packages and dependencies required by the HARAYA program.

### Usage

1. Run the `haraya.py` script in your preferred Python environment, such as the integrated terminal, command prompt, or IDE:

        python haraya.py

   Alternatively, if you are using Windows, you can run or double-click the [H.A.R.A.Y.A.exe](H.A.R.A.Y.A.exe) executable file located in the project directory in order to run `haraya.py`.

Upon running HARAYA, the program will initially utilize the web data scraping system to gather data, such as the current time, date, location, and weather, from the internet. After collecting this information, HARAYA will proceed to initialize the face recognition system and subsequently recognize the face of the person with whom it is interacting.

To fully utilize the face recognition system, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your system has a default camera or webcam configured.

2. Place the images of people you want HARAYA to recognize in the [faces](./faces) directory. Each image file should correspond to a person's face, and the name of the file (excluding the extension) will be used as the person's name.

HARAYA will utilize your system's default camera for face detection and pose estimation. When HARAYA detects a known face, it will log the time and the name of the person in a CSV file named [database.csv](database.csv). After recognizing your face, HARAYA will greet you and ask how she can assist you.

Please note that the successful operation of the face recognition system relies on appropriate lighting conditions and clear images of the faces in the [faces](./faces) directory.
