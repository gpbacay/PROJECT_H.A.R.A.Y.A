The Post-training Optimization Tool contains multiple examples that demonstrate how to use its :doc:`API <pot_compression_api_README>` 
to optimize DL models. All available examples can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/tools/pot/openvino/tools/pot/api/samples>`__.

The following examples demonstrate the implementation of ``Engine``, ``Metric``, and ``DataLoader`` interfaces for various use cases:

1. :doc:`Quantizing Image Classification model <pot_example_classification_README>`

   - Uses a single ``MobilenetV2`` model from TensorFlow
   - Implements ``DataLoader`` to load .JPEG images and annotations of the Imagenet database
   - Implements ``Metric`` interface to calculate Accuracy at top-1 metric
   - Uses DefaultQuantization algorithm for quantization model

2. :doc:`Quantizing Object Detection Model with Accuracy Control <pot_example_object_detection_README>`

   - Uses asingle ``MobileNetV1 FPN`` model from TensorFlow
   - Implements ``Dataloader`` to load images of the COCO database
   - Implements ``Metric`` interface to calculate ``mAP@[.5:.95]`` metric
   - Uses ``AccuracyAwareQuantization`` algorithm for quantization model

3. :doc:`Quantizing Semantic Segmentation Model <pot_example_segmentation_README>`

   - Uses a single ``DeepLabV3`` model from TensorFlow
   - Implements ``DataLoader`` to load .JPEG images and annotations of the Pascal VOC 2012 database
   - Implements ``Metric`` interface to calculate Mean Intersection Over Union metric
   - Uses DefaultQuantization algorithm for quantization model

4. :doc:`Quantizing 3D Segmentation Model <pot_example_3d_segmentation_README>`

   - Uses a single ``Brain Tumor Segmentation`` model from PyTorch
   - Implements ``DataLoader`` to load images in NIfTI format from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon BRATS 2017 database
   - Implements ``Metric`` interface to calculate Dice Index metric
   - Demonstrates how to use image metadata obtained during data loading to post-process the raw model output
   - Uses DefaultQuantization algorithm for quantization model

5. :doc:`Quantizing Cascaded model <pot_example_face_detection_README>`

   - Uses a cascaded (composite) ``MTCNN`` model from Caffe that consists of three separate models in an OpenVINOâ„¢ Intermediate Representation (IR)
   - Implements ``Dataloader`` to load .jpg images of the WIDER FACE database
   - Implements ``Metric`` interface to calculate Recall metric
   - Implements ``Engine`` class that is inherited from ``IEEngine`` to create a complex staged pipeline to sequentially execute each of the three stages of the MTCNN model, represented by multiple models in IR. It uses engine helpers to set a model in OpenVINO Inference Engine and process raw model output for the correct statistics collection
   - Uses DefaultQuantization algorithm for quantization model

6. :doc:`Quantizing for GNA Device <pot_example_speech_README>`

   - Uses models from Kaldi
   - Implements ``DataLoader`` to load data in .ark format
   - Uses DefaultQuantization algorithm for quantization model

After the execution of each example above, the quantized model is placed into the folder ``optimized``. The accuracy validation of the quantized model is performed right after the quantization.
